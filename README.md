#SoniC\# 
soniC# (Pronounced "Sonic Sharp") is an open-source engine based off of the brilliant games in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise written in C# with MonoGame. soniC# is designed to be flexible and easy-to-use, while still being as close to the original game's physics as possible.

This engine was written for fun/educational purposes and has no malicious intent. No one's making any money off of this (Or at least, they SHOULDN'T be. If you find any one making money off of this engine, please report them to me at radfordhound@gmail.com so I can put an end to it. Thanks. :) )
